### [Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tomasdev/symbols-subset/blob/main/test.html)

### How to

Modify the `ICONS` and `FONT_URL` in index.js to the desired one.

Harfbuzz instancing doesn't yet support variable fonts AFAIK.


### Note

Firefox (even latest version) on Windows older than 2017 (or people without system updates) does not support Variable Fonts:
> As per https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1742970#c2, VF support was added to Windows in late 2017.

Maybe other operating systems are affected as well.
